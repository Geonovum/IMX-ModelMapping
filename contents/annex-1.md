# Annex-1

This annex contains the mapping specifications as they are designed to map the IMX-Geo model elements to the basemodels. These mapping specifications are described in an excel spreadsheet and are the input for formulation of the machine readable YAML mapping specifications as they are developed and presented in this document. The mappings specifications furthermore are input for developing the content of the knowledge graph.

The mapping specifications consist of mapping/relating information elements from the IMX-Geo model to information elements from the models of key registers or any model that is considered and included as a source model of the IMX-Geo cross domain model.

Typically the mapping specifications follow this context chain: domain - objecttype - property - valuetype.

The excel contains the following columns with their related explanation.
