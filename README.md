# WaU-MAP

Repository for the development of mapping rules between the semantic layer model IMX-Geo (https://github.com/Geonovum/IMX-Geo) and the existing source model. Mapping rules are at the bases of the implemented lineage model and the actual data publication.

This work is part of the larger project Semantische samenhang tussen basisregistraties. The mother repository of this project is [WaU](https://github.com/Geonovum/WaU).
